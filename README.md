**Team Profile**

This application demonstrates my skill in generating multiple entries for different employees from input from the terminal command line and then displaying this employee information.
There are three types of employees; Manager, Intern and Engineer.  Each type of employee has a name, ID and email that must be entered.  A name must be more than one character, and ID must be a number and an email address must contain the character @.  
Additional information for a manager is an Officer number, which cannot be null and must be a number.
Additional information for an intern is the School, which cannot be null.
Additional information for an engineer is their GITHUB name, which cannot be null.

I have utilised Jest to write tests for the report generation and for the classes Employee, Intern, Engineer and Manager.
